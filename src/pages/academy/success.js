        "When I first thought about going to a code school to change
        careers, I knew it would be hard, especially with three young
        children to care for. I also knew it would be worth it in the end.
        The Iron Yard experience turned out to be just as hard as I ever
        imagined, but also just as worth it. I accomplished what I set out
        to do. And really, there are few things better in life than that.
        Achieving a goal you've worked hard for."

        challenges I have ever taken on and I would not change my decision
        to attend for anything. This gave me a home away from home, it
        became a sanctuary where people of similar mind would share ideas

        of the greatest choices that my brain came up with. Not one day goes
        by since graduating have I been extremely grateful to the school for
        teaching me the valuable skill sets that I now know."

        After over a decade in finance, a layoff put me into a position
