                <h3>Diversity Scholarship</h3>
                <p>Suncoast Developers Guild seeks to narrow the gaps in our industry by introducing local companies to diverse talent. We offer a scholarship to members of communities that are underrepresented in technology.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>This opportunity is available, but not limited to: self-identifying women, people of color, individuals with disabilities, and the LGBTQ community. Members of all underrepresented groups may apply for this scholarship.</li>
                    <li>We will deduct the scholarship amount from the total cost of tuition.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>When enrollment reopens, scholarship applications will be available as part of the standard application process.</p>
